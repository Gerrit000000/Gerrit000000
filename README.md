- 👋 Hi, I’m Gerrit van den Broek, 33 years clever and i am from South - Africa. I got tons of remorse, hope and prayers in me thats real as a organ.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning development, learning different coding languages, learning to be a future ace developer that knows how it goes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by selfstudy, by online help and by making mistakes, correcting them, learning from them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...everything and anything regarding this. im always game, and grateful for Github, XDA and i am listening and looking always.  
- 📫 How to reach me ...i have 2 emails, my computer email is gerritvandenbroek09@gmail.com, my phone email is gerrit69999@gmail.com  I am reachabile on both emails.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...My family calles me "gesiggie", which means babyface. My close friends calls me "giela". Anyone of the Seniors here are wellcome to give me my developer name.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...i love offroading like super crazy. it calms my thoughts, recalibrates me. 
- i worked on the deepest gold mine on earth about 6 years at the lowest level.
- i am absolutely fearless.. but i fear a panic attack more than death itself.... was driving my gti to nowhere after my girlfriend left me taking my son away
-  when it happend the first time. i jumped out of my moving car hahaha. rolling and tumbling on the ground. ready to die.
-  my girlfriends brother drove past me saw my automatic car drive by it self there in the velt and he saved me.
-  since then i am on schedule 6 meds and my fearlessness i will never ever get back.
